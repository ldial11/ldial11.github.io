        <p>Dial Designs is a company founded by self proclaimed billionaire Lane Dial. He created this company in his mind with the soul purpose of designing webpages and whatever else is needed by the client. He and his loyal dog sidekick travel the world meeting with people who are not interested, creating them websites or some other gadgets that they deem necessary for themselves. So far the team has grown from 3 people to 2 and we plan on keeping an upward trend of growth until the CEO's money starts to plateu.</p>
